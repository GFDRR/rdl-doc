# Exposure DB schema

The exposure schema was developed based on [GEM Taxonomy 2.0](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GED4ALL) to accommodate the most important spatial features commonly employed in risk analysis to identify and estimate exposed value. 
The [GED4ALL](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/global-exposure-database-for-all-ged4all) database schema contains the following tables: contribution, exposure\_model, asset, occupancy, cost, cost\_type, and tags.

Multiple types of structural/infrastructure assets and socio-economic exposure can be stored in the exposure database with attributes relevant to assessing risk from multiple hazards. 
The exposure schema provides 11 defined exposure types, for consistent classification of assets in different datasets: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Healthcare, Education, Government, Infrastructure, Crop, Livestock, Forestry, and Mixed (as in _cf\_common.occupancy\_enum_).
The tables include general attributes that can be adapted to each asset type. More specific indicators can be stored using the _tags_ table, e.g. population gender and age, urban growth rate, GDP or others.

Exposure can be stored at multiple scales and using polygon (e.g., for a building footprint or number of buildings in a district), polyline (e.g. road network segment), and point (e.g. geolocated building at a lat,lon position). 
Exposure units can be assigned the number night-time or day-time occupants, to represent population exposure.

###Table: _ged4all.exposure\_model_

Each row in this table represents a collection of assets with a taxonomy\_source (GEM Taxonomy, SynerG, FAO, etc) and category (buildings, road network, etc). 
A model can optionally contain one or more cost types (see model\_cost\_type), e.g. structural, contents and can also optionally contain information about the area occupied by the assets. Finally, a model can optionally specify any number of &quot;tags&quot;, which can be applied to each asset.

| **Req** | **Field name** | **Type** | **Reference table** | **Description** |
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\*** | id | INT | | Unique number ID |
| **\*** | name | VARCHAR | | Name of exposure model |
| | description | VARCHAR | | Description of exposure model |
| | taxonomy\_source | VARCHAR | | Name of taxonomy source |

| | area\_type | VARCHAR | | Aggregated or per asset |
| | area\_unit | VARCHAR | | Unit of measure of area |
| | tag\_names | VARCHAR | | Additional tag information |
| | use | ENUM | _cf\_common.occupancy\_enum_ | Usage type of the asset (e.g. residential, commercial) |

<br/>
###Table: _ged4all.asset_

Each row in the asset table represents a single asset or collection of assets, such as a building, aggregated collection of buildings, an item in an infrastructure network, or an area of farmland. 
The number\_of\_units field is used to specify the number of assets of this type at this location. 
The taxonomy value must be set to a valid taxonomy string using the taxonomy system specified in the exposure\_model table, and identifies the typology of this asset. 

There are two geometry fields providing geospatial information:
- The &quot;the\_geom&quot; field specifies a single point location and can be considered as a composite representation of latitude, longitude and a reference to WGS84. Only Point geometries are stored in this field.
- The &quot;full\_geom&quot; field is an optional representation of any geometry type (point, line, polygon, multipoint, multi-line, etc.) supported by the standard and can be used to describe the footprint of a building, regional boundaries, or lifelines.type (point, line, polygon, multipoint, multi-line, etc.) supported by the standard and can be used to describe the footprint of a building, regional boundaries, or lifelines.

| **Req** | **Field name** | **Type** | **Reference table** | **Description** |
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\*** | id | INT | | Unique number ID |
| **\*** | exposure\_model\_id | INT | _ged4all.exposure\_model_ | Unique number ID of source exposure model |
| **\*** | asset\_ref | VARCHAR | | Alphanumeric code supplied by user |
| **\*** | taxonomy | VARCHAR | | Alphanumeric code for the taxonomy source |
| | number\_of\_units | FLOAT | | Number of assets represented |
| | area | FLOAT | _exposure\_model.area\_unit_ | Area of the asset in the units specified |
| **\*** | the\_geom | GEOM | | Associated geometry data (point location) |
| | full\_geom | GEOM | | Associated geometry data (polygon, multiline, multipolygon...) |

<br/>
###Table: _ged4all.cost\_type_

Each exposure model can optionally have one or more types of cost associated with loss or damage to assets. 
For example, the cost of the building structure by square meter or the cost of the contents of a single building. 
Each cost type entry describes a category of cost, an aggregation type and a unit.

| **Req** | **Field name** | **Type** | **Reference table** | **Description** |
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **\*** | id | INT | | Unique number ID |
| **\*** | exposure\_model\_id | INT | _ged4all.exposure\_model_ | Unique number ID of source exposure model |
| **\*** | cost\_type\_name | VARCHAR | | Type of asset cost (structural, non-structural, contents, business interruption) |
| **\*** | aggregation\_type | VARCHAR | | Aggregated or per asset |
| | unit | VARCHAR | | Cost unit of measure |

<br/>
###Table: _ged4all.cost_

Each row in the cost table represents a cost of a given cost type for a given asset. 
The asset\_id and cost\_type\_id fields are foreign keys used to identify an asset and model\_cost\_type. 
The value field provides the actual cost value in the unit specified in the corresponding model\_cost\_type entry.

| **Req** | **Field name** | **Type** | **Reference table** | **Description** |
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **_\*_** | id | INT | | Unique number ID |
| **\*** | asset\_id | INT | _ged4all.asset_ | Unique number ID of the asset |
| **\*** | cost\_type\_id | VARCHAR | | Unique number ID of the cost type |
| **\*** | value | FLOAT | | Cost value |
| | deductible | FLOAT | | |
| | insurance\_limit | FLOAT | | |

<br/>
###Table: _ged4all.occupancy_

The occupancy table is used to store information about the occupants of an asset in a given period, for example, the number of people in a given building during the day and during the night. 
For some cases the period might refer to a season, for example when considering livestock or agricultural assets. 
In some communities the term &quot;occupancy&quot; is used to refer to building usage, for example &quot;industrial&quot; or &quot;residential&quot;; this concept can be modelled in the GED4ALL schema using tags and/or by using a taxonomy system that supports building usage specification, such as the GEM Building Taxonomy.

| **Req** | **Field name** | **Type** | **Reference table** | **Description** |
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **_\*_** | id | INT | | Unique number ID |
| **\*** | asset\_id | INT | _ged4all.asset_ | Unique number ID of the asset |
| **\*** | period | VARCHAR | | Occupancy type (night/day) |
| **\*** | occupants | FLOAT | | Number of occupants |

<br/>
###Table: _ged4all.tags_

Each row in the tags table represents a name and value pair for a given asset. 
The asset\_id is a foreign key used to identify an asset. 
The name field represents the name of the tag while the value field contains the associated value. 
Tags may be used to store any named scalar information with an asset, but in particular are useful for storing socio-economic indicators and their associated values, and also for grouping assets into census tracts, for example.

| **Req** | **Field name** | **Type** | **Reference table** | **Description** |
|:---:| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **_\*_** | id | INT | | Unique number ID |
| **\*** | asset\_id | INT | _ged4all.asset_ | Unique number ID of the asset |
| **\*** | name | VARCHAR | | Name of the tag |
| **\*** | value | VARCHAR | | Number associated with the tag |

##Taxonomy: GED4all
The exposure schema can accomodate different descriptions of assets using a taxonomy which describes their characteristics (e.g. building occupancy, construction, age, height, etc. or road surface type). The taxonomy being applied to a dataset is defined in _ged4all.exposure\_model.taxonomy\_source_. The taxonomy string, which describes all the characteristics of the asset (or group of assets of the same type), is defined at _ged4all.asset.taxonomy_. <br>We encourage the use of GED4all taxonomy, described in full [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GED4ALL).<br>
In order to summarise all the asset information into a single alphanumeric string, a tool will be provided, similar to the ['taxtweb'](https://platform.openquake.org/taxtweb/) tool available from GEM dedicated to _buildings_ taxonomy.

The taxonomy covers four main categories:

- [Buildings](#buildings)
- [Lifelines](#lifelines)
- [Crops, Livestock and Forestry](#crops-livestock-and-forestry)
- [Socio-Economic indicators](#socio-economic-indicators)

###Buildings
The buildings taxonomy is based on GEM openquake taxonomy, with some semplifications. The taxonomy string is built as sequence of attributes separeted by slash:

`MATERIAL/HEIGHT/DATE/OCCUPANCY/SHAPE/â€¦`

Missing attributes can be skipped from the string, e.g.

###Lifelines
The **lifelines** taxonomy includes all infrastructures commonly found in populated areas, such as:

- [Roads and railways](#roads-and-railways)
- [Pipelines](#pipelines)
- [Energy generation and power grid](#energy-generation-and-power-grid)
- [Potable water and wastewater system](#potable-water-and-wastewater-systems)
- [Communication systems](#communication-systems)

Three main sources of information have been used for the definition of this taxonomy: FP7 EU Project [Syner-G](http://www.vce.at/SYNER-G), HAZUS11 recommendations, and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) classification system.

####Roads and railways

This taxonomy is strongly based on the classification system adopted by OpenStreetMap, since OSM is undoubtedly the largest and most complete source of open information concerning the location of roads and railways.
The taxonomy string is simply `TYPE+CATEGORY`, e.g.

Secondary road: `RDN+SE`

| Attribute | Code | Description |
|-|:-:|-|
| Road   network | RDN+MO | Motorway: restricted access major divided highway (i.e. freeway), normally with 2 or   more running lanes plus emergency hard shoulder |
|  | RDN+TR | Trunk:   the most important roads in a country's system that aren't motorways (not necessarily be a divided highway) |
|  | RDN+PR | Primary:   the next most important roads in a country's system (often link larger towns) |
|  | RDN+SE | Secondary:   the next most important roads in a country's system (often link towns) |
|  | RDN+TE | Tertiary:   the next most important roads in a country's system (often link smaller towns and villages) |
|  | RDN+UN | Unclassified:   the least  important through roads in a country's system (often link villages and hamlets) |
|  | RDN+RE | Residential:   roads which serve as an access to housing, without function of connecting settlements. Often lined with housing. |
|  | RDN+SR | Service:   access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. |
|  | RDN | Unknown:   no  information concerning road typology |
| Railway network | RLW+LR | Light rail: a higher-standard tram system, normally in its own right-of-way. Often reaches a considerable length (tens of kilometer) |
|  | RLW+MR | Monorail:   a single-rail railway |
|  | RLW+RL | Rail:   full sized passenger or freight trains in the standard gauge for the country or state |
|  | RLW+SW | Subway:   a city passenger underground rail service running mostly grade separated |
|  | RLW+TR | Tram:   one or two carriage rail vehicles, usually sharing motor road. |
|  | RLW | Unknown:   no additional information concerning rail typology. |

<br/>

####Pipelines

The taxonomy presented herein has been developed using the classification experience developed in Syner-G and STREST (Crowley et al., 2016).
The taxonomy string is simply `PPL/CONTENT/POSITION/MATERIAL/JOINT_TYPE/SOIL_TYPE/DIAMETER`, e.g.

####Energy generation and power grid

We follow the taxonomy adopted by HAZUS, which allows capturing the capacity (e.g. voltage) of the elements. For the purposes of assessing damage due to natural disasters, it is also relevant to identify the presence of anchorage and  whether the elements have been designed according to a particular code. The taxonomy for component of the power grid can thus be presented in the following manner: `PWG/ENERGYSOURCE/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS`, e.g.

Electric ditribution line through pylones: `PWG/SSM/ANC`

| Attribute | Code | Description |
|-|:-:|-|

####Potable water and wastewater systems

Potable water systems are comprised by water treatment plants, storage tanks, pipelines and pumping stations, while wastewater systems are composed by wasterwater treatment plants, lifting stations and
pipelines. Our classification is based on the HAZUS guidelines.

The alphanumeric taxonomy strings are:<br>
`PWR/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS` for potable water<br>

###Crops, Livestock and Forestry

The taxonomy for crops, livestock and forestry was defined based on existing classification systems supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). For crops, the classification system in the 2000 agricultural census programme was adopted. This system comprises a wide range of attributes such as growing cycle (temporary/permanent), crop species, crop variety, season, land type, amongst others. The taxonomy proposed herein uses the first and second categorization levels proposed by FAO, as well as the growing cycle (e.g. permanent or temporary). A simple alphanumeric code is attributed to each class of crop.

####Forestry

| Attribute | Code | Description |
|-|:-:|-|
| Closed forest | FRT1+1 | Mainly evergreen forest - the canopy is never without green foliage, but individual trees may shed their leaves (e.g. Sumatra, Atrato Valley (Colombia), Atlantic slopes of Costa Rica, Amazon Basin). |
|  | FRT1+2 | Mainly deciduous forest - majority of trees shed their foliage simultaneously in connection to unfavourable season (e.g. North and South America, Southern slopes of the Himalayas and Europe) |
|  | FRT1+3 | Extremely xeromorphic forest - dense stands of trees, composed by species such as bottle or tuft rees with succulent leaves (e.g. thorn forest in Southwestern North America and Southwestern Africa) |
| Woodland | FRT2+1 | Mainly evergreen woodland - the canopy is never without green foliage, but individual trees may shed their leaves (e.g. Mediterranean Basin). |
|  | FRT2+2 | Mainly deciduous woodland - majority of trees shed their foliage simultaneously in connection to unfavourable season (e.g. Southern California and American Southeast, Mediterranean Basin) |
|  | FRT2+3 | Extremely xeromorphic woodland - dense stands of trees, composed by species such as bottle or tuft rees with succulent leaves (e.g. Southwestern North America and Southwestern Africa) |
| Scrub | FRT3+1 | Mainly evergreen scrub - the canopy is never without green foliage, but individual species may shed their leaves (e.g. Mediterranean dwarf palm shrubland, Chaparral shrubland in California or Hawaiian tree fern thicket). |
|  | FRT3+2 | Mainly deciduous scrub - majority of scrub shed their foliage simultaneously in connection to unfavourable season (e.g. peat mosses in Scotland) |
|  | FRT3+3 | Extremely xeromorphic (subdesert) shrubland - very open stands of shrubs, often composed by vegetation with green branches without leaves, some of them with thorns (e.g. mulga scrub in Australia). |
| Dwarf-scrub and related communities | FRT4+1 | Mainly evergreen dwarf-scrub - mostly dense dwarf scrub evergreen dominating the landscape (e.g. East Mediterranean mountains). |
|  | FRT4+2 | Mainly deciduous scrub - majority of vegetation shed their foliage simultaneously in connection to unfavourable season (e.g. Sierra Nevada in California ) |
|  | FRT4+3 | Extremely xeromorphic dwarf-shrubland - more or less open formations consisting of dwarf-shrubs or succulent species (e.g. Australia). |
|  | FRT4+4 | Tundra - slowly growing, low formations, consisting mainly of dwarf-shrubs beyond the subpolar tree line (e.g. Alaska, Northern Canada, Greenland, Norway, Finland and Siberia). |
|  | FRT4+5 | Mossy bog formations with dwarf-shrub - peat accumulations formed mainly by mosses which generally cover the surface as well (e.g. Western  Siberian Lowlands in Russia). |
| Herbaceous vegetation | FRT5+1 | Tall graminoid vegetation - Mostly composed by tall grasslands with heights of over 2 m. Forbs can be presented but their coverage is less than 50% (e.g. Northeast Bolivia, African savannah and upper Nile Valley). |
|  | FRT5+2 | Medium tall grassland - Mostly composed by grasslands with heights between 0.5 and 2 m. Forbs can be presented but their coverage is less than 50% (e.g. Sahel region in Africa, Eastern Kansas, glasslands in New Zealand) |
|  | FRT5+3 | Short grassland - Mostly composed by grasslands with heights below 0.5 m. Forbs can be presented but their coverage is less than 50% (e.g. alpine regions of Kenya, Colombia and Venezuela). |
|  | FRT5+4 | Forb vegetation - the plant community if mostly composed by forbs (more than 50%). (e.g. Sonoran Desert) |
|  | FRT5+5 | Hydromorphic fresh-water vegetation - mostly composed by aquatic plants that are structurally supported by water, in wet or flooded regions most of the year (e.g. Amazon Basin) |

###Socio-Economic indicators

Natural hazards are a complex phenomenon featuring large number of interactions that result into loss of lives, livelihoods and interruption of systems. The socio-economic indicators are related to the capacity of populations to prepare, respond and recover from potential damage. For example, education theme is related to awareness, which is essential for a population to avoid and cope with a disaster. The Socio-economic Indicators taxonomy aims at identifying and describing a set of variables which provide a basis for understanding and measuring resilience, social vulnerability and economic vulnerability. The taxonomy system is divided into eight main themes (economy, education, environment, government and institutional capacity, index, health, infrastructure and population), each theme is later subdivided to different levels of detail. The eight main themes in the Socio-economic Indicator Taxonomy are the following:

- [Population](#population): defines community demographics: structure, distribution and size.
- [Economy](#economy): measures the welfare and social security levels of communities
- [Education](#education): provides information about invested resources and expected outcome of education, access and participation to education
- [Environment](#environment): defines the underlying conditions that make an environment susceptible to damage, disaster experience and prevalence
- [Governance and institutional capacity](#governance): institutional performance and regulatory efficiency, corruption control and stability of political system
- [Health](#health): population health conditions and health sector capabilities
- [Index](#index): range of indexes that cover different sectors, for example, the Disaster Risk Index used by the United Nation Development programme to monitor the global evolution of risk.
- [Infrastructure](#infrastructure): Transportation and communication infrastructure, status and access to utility lifelines
