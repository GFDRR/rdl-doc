It provides: a consistent framework for describing the most common types of data used in risk assessment. a database that stores all four data types together, with explicit links for data generated under the same project. a connection between technically compatible datasets, e.g. hazard and vulnerability data with matching applicability. The RDL helps anyone working with or creating risk data (particularly disaster risk analysts and researchers preparing data for risk assessment), by making datasets significantly easier to identify, understand and work with, as they are formatted with a common schema tailored to the requirements of risk modelling. Schema benefits A single consistent nomenclature for hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss datasets simplifies the task of preparing data for risk assessments. Enables storage of risk data for accessible sharing with the community. All data is stored with metadata focussed on providing the information required to assess its suitably for risk modelling projects including source, licence, development method, units, and hazard processes it relates to. Built-in machine- and human-readable metadata makes it easier to understand the data contents and lays the foundation for data search and for future automation. Free and open-source for community improvement of the schema and development of a project database. The schema can provide a consistent data source for analytical and visualisation applications, accessing data via OpenAPI. Use cases An academic research team has generated new risk information and needs to demonstrate the impact of their work, and make the data available for others access. They can upload the data in a consistent format with comprehensive metadata according to the schema, set up a library database using the open source code, and establish a project data library. Value: The pre-designed open-source deployable solutions can assist a research group achieve impact efficiently. A risk analyst is scoping a risk assessment or risk reduction project and would like to identify what risk data exists in their project location. By accessing the Risk Data Library they can see what data is available for that area from the World Bank. Using the comprehensive metadata, they can summarise the existing information and assess whether the data is suitable use or invest in improving it. Value: Reduced time taken to find existing data. Bespoke metadata provides information that the risk analysts needs to make decisions on usage. A development bank produces public good dashboards to deliver risk insights to clients. These dashboards ingest various risk data from their projects and open sources. By making use of the Risk Data Library APIs, each of the dashboards can access the required datasets on request form one or more libraries, display the data as required and reference selected metadata to inform client decisions. Value: Efficient data pipelines to ingest multiple datasets with confidence in the consistency of data structure and metadata. Reasons for confidence in the schema as a solution Developed by experts in generating and using hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss data The solution delivers on findings of community consultation on how to make risk data easier to work with, responding to the needs of the risk community Community feedback has been sought and acted on throughout the project Early expert reviews of the schema have confirmed the value and informed development The proliferation of data management and interoperability initiatives in DRM and insurance sectors shows an ongoing for this type of solution The importance of adoption & application The value of the schema multiplies with use. The more datasets using the schema, the greater its overall contribution. Without widespread adoption, the schema\u2019s benefits will be limited to teams and projects that use it.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"index.html#risk-data-library-documentation","text":"","title":"Risk Data Library documentation"},{"location":"index.html#general-aim","text":"The Risk Data Schema (riskdatalibrary.org) is a language for describing hazard, exposure, vulnerability and modelled loss data.

The GED4ALL database schema contains the following tables: contribution, exposure_model, asset, occupancy, cost, cost_type, and tags. Multiple types of structural/infrastructure assets and socio-economic exposure can be stored in the exposure database with attributes relevant to assessing risk from multiple hazards. The exposure schema provides 11 defined exposure types, for consistent classification of assets in different datasets: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Healthcare, Education, Government, Infrastructure, Crop, Livestock, Forestry, and Mixed (as in cf_common.occupancy_enum ). The tables include general attributes that can be adapted to each asset type. More specific indicators can be stored using the tags table, e.g. population gender and age, urban growth rate, GDP or others. Exposure can be stored at multiple scales and using polygon (e.g., for a building footprint or number of buildings in a district), polyline (e.g. road network segment), and point (e.g. geolocated building at a lat,lon position). Exposure units can be assigned the number night-time or day-time occupants, to represent population exposure. ERD (exposure schema): exposure table contents (green) and links to common tables (yellow). The schema includes a SQL view (cyan). Table: ged4all.exposure_model Each row in this table represents a collection of assets with a taxonomy_source (GEM Taxonomy, SynerG, FAO, etc) and category (buildings, road network, etc). A model can optionally contain one or more cost types (see model_cost_type), e.g. structural, contents and can also optionally contain information about the area occupied by the assets. Finally, a model can optionally specify any number of \"tags\", which can be applied to each asset. Req Field name Type Reference table Description * id INT Unique number ID * name VARCHAR Name of exposure model description VARCHAR Description of exposure model taxonomy_source VARCHAR Name of taxonomy source * category ENUM ged4all.category_enum Type of asset area_type VARCHAR Aggregated or per asset area_unit VARCHAR Unit of measure of area tag_names VARCHAR Additional tag information use ENUM cf_common.occupancy_enum Usage type of the asset (e.g. residential, commercial) Table: ged4all.asset Each row in the asset table represents a single asset or collection of assets, such as a building, aggregated collection of buildings, an item in an infrastructure network, or an area of farmland. The number_of_units field is used to specify the number of assets of this type at this location. The taxonomy value must be set to a valid taxonomy string using the taxonomy system specified in the exposure_model table, and identifies the typology of this asset. There are two geometry fields providing geospatial information: - The \"the_geom\" field specifies a single point location and can be considered as a composite representation of latitude, longitude and a reference to WGS84. Only Point geometries are stored in this field. - The \"full_geom\" field is an optional representation of any geometry type (point, line, polygon, multipoint, multi-line, etc.) supported by the standard and can be used to describe the footprint of a building, regional boundaries, or lifelines.type (point, line, polygon, multipoint, multi-line, etc.) supported by the standard and can be used to describe the footprint of a building, regional boundaries, or lifelines.

Table: ged4all.cost_type Each exposure model can optionally have one or more types of cost associated with loss or damage to assets. For example, the cost of the building structure by square meter or the cost of the contents of a single building. Each cost type entry describes a category of cost, an aggregation type and a unit.

For some cases the period might refer to a season, for example when considering livestock or agricultural assets. In some communities the term \"occupancy\" is used to refer to building usage, for example \"industrial\" or \"residential\"; this concept can be modelled in the GED4ALL schema using tags and/or by using a taxonomy system that supports building usage specification, such as the GEM Building Taxonomy.

The asset_id is a foreign key used to identify an asset. The name field represents the name of the tag while the value field contains the associated value. Tags may be used to store any named scalar information with an asset, but in particular are useful for storing socio-economic indicators and their associated values, and also for grouping assets into census tracts, for example.

The taxonomy being applied to a dataset is defined in ged4all.exposure_model.taxonomy_source . The taxonomy string, which describes all the characteristics of the asset (or group of assets of the same type), is defined at ged4all.asset.taxonomy . We encourage the use of GED4all taxonomy, described in full here . In order to summarise all the asset information into a single alphanumeric string, a tool will be provided, similar to the 'taxtweb' tool available from GEM dedicated to buildings taxonomy. The taxonomy covers four main categories: Buildings Lifelines Crops, Livestock and Forestry Socio-Economic indicators Buildings The buildings taxonomy is based on GEM openquake taxonomy, with some semplifications. The taxonomy string is built as sequence of attributes separeted by slash: MATERIAL/HEIGHT/DATE/OCCUPANCY/SHAPE/\u2026 Missing attributes can be skipped from the string, e.g. 2-floors detached residential dwelling, reinforced concrete structure: CR/H:2/RES1 Attribute Code Description Material of the Lateral Load-Resisting System (LLRS) -- Unknown material C Concrete, unknown reinforcement CU Concrete, unreinforced * CR Concrete, reinforced SRC Concrete, composite with steel section S Steel ME Metal (except steel) M Masonry, unknown reinforcement MUR Masonry, unreinforced MCF Masonry, confined MR Masonry, reinforced E Earth, unknown reinforcement EU Earth, unreinforced ER Earth, reinforced W Wood MIX Mixed materials (hybrid or composite) INF Informal materials MATO Other material Height -- Number of storeys unknown H:n n is the exact number of storeys above ground HBET:a-b a-b is the range of number of storeys above ground (a=upper bound, and b= lower bound). a-b, range of number of storeys above HAPP:n HAPP:n, approximate number of storeys above ground.

Roads and railways This taxonomy is strongly based on the classification system adopted by OpenStreetMap, since OSM is undoubtedly the largest and most complete source of open information concerning the location of roads and railways. The taxonomy string is simply TYPE+CATEGORY , e.g. Secondary road: RDN+SE Attribute Code Description Road network RDN+MO Motorway: restricted access major divided highway (i.e. freeway), normally with 2 or more running lanes plus emergency hard shoulder RDN+TR Trunk: the most important roads in a country's system that aren't motorways (not necessarily be a divided highway) RDN+PR Primary: the next most important roads in a country's system (often link larger towns) RDN+SE Secondary: the next most important roads in a country's system (often link towns) RDN+TE Tertiary: the next most important roads in a country's system (often link smaller towns and villages) RDN+UN Unclassified: the least important through roads in a country's system (often link villages and hamlets) RDN+RE Residential: roads which serve as an access to housing, without function of connecting settlements. Often lined with housing. RDN+SR Service: access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. RDN Unknown: no information concerning road typology Railway network RLW+LR Light rail: a higher-standard tram system, normally in its own right-of-way. Often reaches a considerable length (tens of kilometer) RLW+MR Monorail: a single-rail railway RLW+RL Rail: full sized passenger or freight trains in the standard gauge for the country or state RLW+SW Subway: a city passenger underground rail service running mostly grade separated RLW+TR Tram: one or two carriage rail vehicles, usually sharing motor road. RLW Unknown: no additional information concerning rail typology. Pipelines The taxonomy presented herein has been developed using the classification experience developed in Syner-G and STREST (Crowley et al., 2016). The taxonomy string is simply PPL/CONTENT/POSITION/MATERIAL/JOINT_TYPE/SOIL_TYPE/DIAMETER , e.g. Large elevated pipe for potable water: CPW/PEL/DLG Attribute Code Description Content CGS Gas COL Oil CPW Potable water CWW Wastewater COT Other content -- Unknown Position PBU Buried PEL Elevated Material MPC Polyvinyl chloride MPE Polyethylene MCI Cast iron MDI Ductile iron MWS Welded steel MRM Reinforced plastic mortar MRM Resin transfer moulding MAC Asbestos-cement MC Concrete MCL Clay MO Other material MUB Unknown, brittle MUD Unknown, ductile -- Unknown material Joint type JAW Arc welded JGW Gas welded JCE Cemented JFW Fillet weld JBS Bell and spigot (caulked) JRI Riveted JMR Mechanical restrained JSC Screwed JRU Rubber gasket JSG Unknown, segmented JCO Unknown, continuous JO Other joint -- Unknown joint Soil type SCO Corrosive SNC Non corrosive -- Unknown soil type Diameter DSM Small (< 40 cm) DLG Large (\u2265 40 cm) -- Unknown diameter Energy generation and power grid We follow the taxonomy adopted by HAZUS, which allows capturing the capacity (e.g. voltage) of the elements. For the purposes of assessing damage due to natural disasters, it is also relevant to identify the presence of anchorage and whether the elements have been designed according to a particular code. The taxonomy for component of the power grid can thus be presented in the following manner: PWG/ENERGYSOURCE/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS , e.g. Electric ditribution line through pylones: PWG/SSM/ANC Attribute Code Description Energy Source OIL Oil GEO Geothermal NUC Nuclear HYD Hydroelectric WND Wind SOL Solar TDL Tidal wave GAS Gas BIO Biomass O Other -- Unknown Power Capacity PC: Value (integer) -- Unknown power capacity Power grid SSL Low Voltage (<115 KV) Substation SSM Medium Voltage (115-500 KV) Substation SSH High Voltage (>500 KV) Substation DTC Distribution circuit TMT Transmission tower Grid anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code C99 Code provisions unknown Potable water and wastewater systems Potable water systems are comprised by water treatment plants, storage tanks, pipelines and pumping stations, while wastewater systems are composed by wasterwater treatment plants, lifting stations and pipelines. Our classification is based on the HAZUS guidelines. The alphanumeric taxonomy strings are: PWR/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS for potable water WWR/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE PROVISIONS for wasterwater Attribute Code Description Potable water PWR Component PWS Small potable water treatment plant (<50 MGD) PWM Medium potable water treatment plant (50-200 MGD) PWL Large potable water treatment plant (>200 MGD) PPS Small pumping plant (<10 MGD) PPM Medium pumping plant (10-50 MGD) PPL Large pumping plant (>50 MGD) Anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code -- Code provisions unknown Wastewater WWR Component WWS Small wastewater treatment plant (<50 MGD) WWM Medium wastewater treatment plant (50-200 MGD) WWL Large wastewater treatment plant (>200 MGD) LSS Small lift station (<10 MGD) LSM Medium lift station (10-50 MGD) LSL Large lift station (>50 MGD) Anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code -- Code provisions unknown Communication systems A communication system is comprised by offices dedicated to the reception and dissimination of information (e.g. telephones offices, call centers, TV stations, radio station, telecomunication stations), supporting transmitter towers and distribution circuits. The components have been classified based on the classification system proposed by HAZUS. For the purposes of assessing damage due to natural disasters, it is also relevant to identify the presence of anchorage and whether the elements have been designed according to a particular code. The taxonomy string for the components of a communication system is: COM/COMPONENT/ANCHORAGE/CODE Attribute Code Description Component TRD AM or FM radio transmitters TTV TV stations or transmitters TWE Weather stations or transmitters TTT Telecommunication transmitters TOT Other stations or transmitters DTC Distribution circuit Anchorage ANC Anchored AUN Unanchored -- Unknown anchorage Code provisions CDN No code (non-engineered) CDL Low code CDM Moderate code CDH High code -- Code provisions unknown Crops, Livestock and Forestry The taxonomy for crops, livestock and forestry was defined based on existing classification systems supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). For crops, the classification system in the 2000 agricultural census programme was adopted. This system comprises a wide range of attributes such as growing cycle (temporary/permanent), crop species, crop variety, season, land type, amongst others. The taxonomy proposed herein uses the first and second categorization levels proposed by FAO, as well as the growing cycle (e.g. permanent or temporary). A simple alphanumeric code is attributed to each class of crop.

The socio-economic indicators are related to the capacity of populations to prepare, respond and recover from potential damage. For example, education theme is related to awareness, which is essential for a population to avoid and cope with a disaster. The Socio-economic Indicators taxonomy aims at identifying and describing a set of variables which provide a basis for understanding and measuring resilience, social vulnerability and economic vulnerability. The taxonomy system is divided into eight main themes (economy, education, environment, government and institutional capacity, index, health, infrastructure and population), each theme is later subdivided to different levels of detail. The eight main themes in the Socio-economic Indicator Taxonomy are the following: Population : defines community demographics: structure, distribution and size. Economy : measures the welfare and social security levels of communities Education : provides information about invested resources and expected outcome of education, access and participation to education Environment : defines the underlying conditions that make an environment susceptible to damage, disaster experience and prevalence Governance and institutional capacity : institutional performance and regulatory efficiency, corruption control and stability of political system Health : population health conditions and health sector capabilities Index : range of indexes that cover different sectors, for example, the Disaster Risk Index used by the United Nation Development programme to monitor the global evolution of risk. Infrastructure : Transportation and communication infrastructure, status and access to utility lifelines Population Attribute Code Description Population Structure POPPPSPOP Population POPPPSRPP Rural population POPPPSRUB Urbanization Rate POPPPSSRI Sex ratio POPPPSUPR Urban population POPPPSADP Age dependency ratio POPPPSAPD Average Population Density (areas over 400 ppl/km2) POPPPSCAO Percentage of land area with over 400 people per km2 POPPPSIMP Foreign Born Migrants POPPPSLPF Labour force participation rate -

Multiple types of structural/infrastructure assets and socio-economic exposure can be stored in the exposure database with attributes relevant to assessing risk from multiple hazards.

The tables include general attributes that can be adapted to each asset type. More specific indicators can be stored using the tags table, e.g. population gender and age, urban growth rate, GDP or others. Exposure can be stored at multiple scales and using polygon (e.g., for a building footprint or number of buildings in a district), polyline (e.g. road network segment), and point (e.g. geolocated building at a lat,lon position).
